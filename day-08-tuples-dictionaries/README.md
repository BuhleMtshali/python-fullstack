# 📞🔖 Phone Book Console App — Mini Project 🐝✨

## 🌟 Overview

- This project is a Phone Book Console Application built with Python 🐍.

- It allows users to store, view, and remove contacts using a menu-driven interface — just like a tiny CLI version of a real phone book 📱📋.

- The app starts with a short delay ⏳ for dramatic effect and then runs continuously until the user chooses to exit.

## 🎯 What This App Can Do 🎮

- 👥 Add contacts with:

    - Name

    - Relationship

    - Phone number

- 📋 View all saved contacts in a clean, readable format

- 🚫 Remove contacts by name

- 🛡️ Prevent duplicate entries

- 🔁 Perform multiple actions without restarting the program


## 🧠 Python Concepts Practiced 🐍

- 🧩 Functions for modular logic

- 🔁 while True loops for menu systems

- 🎛️ match / case (Python switch statements)

- 📋 Lists of dictionaries for structured data

- 🔍 Searching and modifying lists safely

- 🛡️ Defensive programming (duplicate checks & safe removal)

- ⏱️ Delayed execution using threading.Timer


## 📦 Data Structure Used 📒

Each contact is stored as a dictionary:
