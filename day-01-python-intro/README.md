## 🐍 Day 1 – Python Basics (Hello World)


### 📌 Overview

- Day 1 marks the official start of my Python roadmap.

- The goal for today was simple: set up the environment and write my first Python program.

- No overthinking. No overengineering. Just making sure Python runs and speaks back.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to create a Python file (.py)

- How variables work in Python

- How to use the print() function to display output

- How Python executes code line by line


## 🧪 Code Example

```
message = "Hello World!!"
print(message)

```

## 🔍 Explanation (plain English)

- message is a variable that stores text (a string)

- "Hello World!!" is the value assigned to the variable

- print(message) tells Python to display the value on the screen

- When the program runs, Python prints:

```
Hello World!!

```

## 🎯 Why This Matters

- This might look tiny, but this is the foundation of everything:

    - Variables

    - Output

    - Program execution

- Every serious Python project starts right here.


## 🚀 Next Steps (Day 2)

- Data types

- User input

- Simple interactions


✨ Status: Day 1 complete

🧠 Mindset: Building fundamentals, not rushing
