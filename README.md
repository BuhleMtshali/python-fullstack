# 🐍✨ Full-Stack Python Dev Journey: 100 Days to Guru Mode

Welcome to my **Python-Powered Full-Stack Developer Grind** 💻🔥  

This repo is my sacred dojo — a 100-day marathon of daily projects, late-night debugging, and "aha!" moments.  

📅 **Timeline**: January - December 2026  

🎯 **Mission**: Become a certified Python wizard 🧙🏾‍♀️ and build jaw-dropping, job-ready apps from scratch.

## 🌈 What's Poppin' in This Repo?

Every folder = one day, one project, one level up 💪 
 
We're going full beast mode on everything from:

- 🐍 Python Fundamentals (core to guru-level)

- 💡 Algorithms & Data Structures (coding like a boss)

- 🎨 Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS basics)

- 🛠️ Backend (Flask, Django, REST APIs)

- 🧠 Automation & Scripting (make life easier)

- 🔐 Authentication, Security, CI/CD

- ☁️ Cloud Deployment (Heroku, Vercel, Firebase, etc.)

- 🧪 Testing + Debugging (write code that doesn’t cry)

- 🤖 AI/ML Intros (optional boss fights)

- 📦 DevOps, GitHub Actions, Docker (cause why not?)
